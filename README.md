# Data_Bootcamp_Project

This project was completed by Meetali Gupta in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.232 Section 2, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that: Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description: Nature vs. Nurture-- our environment has long been thought to have an effect on our success in life. We decided to explore the relationship between household structures of children growing up and their likelihood to attain higher education. Looking at panel data across all 50 states, in addition the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, across the years 2000-2017, we compared varying aspects of household structure with different levels of educational attainment on the state level. We were unable to draw a solid correlation between the two variables and suspect more influential ommitted variables are responsible for between-state differences in educational attainment.
